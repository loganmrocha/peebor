            It took me a decade, but I finally built my Dream PC. There are many like it, but this one is mine. My previous build had a 5950x and ASUS Crosshair VIII Dark Hero, but the motherboard started having power on issues.</p>
            <p>CPU: AMD Ryzen 7950x</p>
            <p>GPU: NVIDIA RTX 3090</p>
            <p>MOBO: ASUS X670E Crosshair Hero</p>
            <p>RAM: 32GB G.Skill Flare X5 @ 6000 MT/s CL 30</p>
            <p>PCIe Gen 4.0 SSD: 1TB Firecuda 530</p>
            <p>PCIe Gen 3.0 SSD: 1TB PNY CS3030</p>

        <p>
            Funny story, I actually got the RTX 3090 for free by attending an NVIDIA tech talk to UIUC students in Fall 2021! 
            They had a giveaway in which I had a 0.5% chance of winning, but I won and was extremely lucky given the GPU shortage.

                Illini Esports had a contest for beefiest PC and I threw the OG Dream PC in the ring despite there being some fierce competitors. Turns out the judges decided on my Dream PC and I got a gift card that I put toward the PCIe 4.0 SSD.

        <p>I tossed the HDDs from the OG PC into an Unraid server so I can enjoy OTA broadcasts with an HDHomeRun tuner. Currently almost maxing out on storage so once a great deal pops up count me in!</p>
