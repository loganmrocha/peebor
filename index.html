    <p>Above used to be Andrea's profile photo from <a href="https://www.x.com/andreafinn99/photo">X</a> to give me a refresher on sourcing an image. The last time I used HTML was in middle school on Codecademy. 
        I want to update it to dynamically source her profile picture instead of manually inserting a hardcoded link to the image, but will need to save that feature for a later date.
        In the meantime, enjoy this lovely photo of us on our wedding day!

        <p>My goal is to learn web development skills. My rules are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Zero copied lines of code</li>
            <li>Comprehension of what every line of code means</li>
            <li>Focus on accessible design by adhering to the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla Developer Network's documentation</a></li>
        </ul>
