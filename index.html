        <p>Above is Andrea's profile picture pulled from <a href="https://www.twitter.com/andreafinn99/photo">Twitter</a> to give me a refresher on sourcing an image. The last time I used HTML was in middle school on Codecademy. </p>
        <p>My goal is to learn web development skills. My rules are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Zero copied lines of code</li>
            <li>Comprehension of what every line of code means</li>
            <li>Never work on this project at work ðŸ˜‰</li>
        </ul>
