            During winter break of my senior year of college I studied for the technician class amateur radio license. I was fortunate enough to sit for the exam administered by the GLAARG VEC and passed the exam to initially get the callsign of KD9UCU.
            My current callsign is KC9DEZ. This was the same callsign my grandfather used on amateur radio and I wanted to carry on his legacy over the airwaves.

            My current kit is soley comprised of a Baofeng UV-5R HT, but I intend to obtain a Motorola HT in the near future. Currently not sure if DXing on HF band is the next step in my journey, but it does sound fun!
